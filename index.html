                My name is John Clapper, I'm originally from Massachusetts and I've lived in 7 states.
                I was one of the first of my friends to have a computer growing up so I spent a lot 
                of time on it, mostly playing video games, downloading music and chatting with friends.  
                I wasn't the biggest fan of the public school system so, I dropped out of high school 
                and got my GED instead. After getting my GED I got accepted into Johnson and Wales University 
                where I got my associates degree in culinary arts. I spent 14 years in the restaurant industry
                and I learned a lot about working under pressure with efficency and speed, managing my time, 
                managing a full staff of employees (sometimes at various locations), putting out fires on the 
                fly (literally and figuratively) and teamwork.  Since I've left the restaurant industry I've 
                worked a few entry level positions and its clear that the those fundamentals carry over into 
                other fields. My latest job was as a technical support associate at a seasonal dance festival 
                in Western Mass. There I got to set up computers and email for seasonal and full-time staff, 
                installed and trained staff on a new VOIP system, assist and train staff with Google Workspace, 
                Microsoft Office and Zoom. I love to learn new things especially in the tech field. I've done a 
                fair amount of studying on cloud technologies and feel most comfortable with Microsoft Azure. 
                Most recently I got the Microsoft AZ-900 certification you can find in the link on the left. You 
                can also find a link to the rules of disc golf and a cool picture of Santa on a roof that I had AI
                make.

            <h2>Why web development?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                My personal motto is and has been: "Always a student" and I feel web development is the perfect place 
                to exercise that motto. My end goal is to have a career in an industry with a lot to learn, one without a ceiling and one
                that rewards hard work and passion. I chose web development because it seems to be in high demand, 
                pays well, and can open the door to a lot of other opportunities if I work hard and keep learning.
                Since I started learning web development, I realize I'm having a lot of fun solving the problems presented to
                me and look forward to the long road ahead.
